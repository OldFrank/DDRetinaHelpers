How to use:

build the project
cd to the directory where the app is built
run the app by executing the following command:
	./RetinaExtension --from /path/where/your/files/are/ --to /path/where/you/want/to/save/

the app will copy all JPEG, JPG and PNG files to the destination path after having added the @2x extension
